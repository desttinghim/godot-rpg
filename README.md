# RPG

This is a pokemon style RPG made in Godot. I'm not sure exactly what it will
be about yet, but I am having fun experimenting! This project will be open 
source, but if I ever finish it, it will go up on itch.io as pay-what-you-want.
Images, sounds, and other stuff will be licensed under creative commons share 
alike (preserving credit) and code under the expat (MIT) license.
